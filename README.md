# 🚗 Automatic Rain Sensing Car Wipers

An intelligent embedded system that detects rainfall using capacitive and conductive sensors and automates wiper activation based on real-time rain intensity and GPS data. This project enhances driver safety by reducing distraction during inclement weather conditions.

## 📌 Project Description

This system automatically controls car windshield wipers using rain sensors and GPS data. It detects rain through real-time sensor readings and activates the wipers accordingly, adjusting their speed based on intensity. The inclusion of GPS allows environment-aware decisions and avoids false positives. A servo motor simulates the wiper motion for testing purposes.
